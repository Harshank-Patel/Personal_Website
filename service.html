                        Bochasanwasi Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS), is a Hindu denomination within the
                        Swaminarayan Sampradaya. It was formed by Yagnapurushdas (Shastriji Maharaj) on the principle
                        that Swaminarayan was to remain present on earth through a lineage of gurus dating all the way
                        back to Gunatitanand Swami â€“ one of Swaminarayan's most prominent disciples. <br>
                        My service duties include helping wash dishes, clean the kitchen floor and serve food to the
                        needy.<br><br>
                        Due to COVID-19, I havent been able to do anything at all, but as soon as I get vaccinated, I
                        will be helping them feed the needy.
