                        Hi, I am Harshank Patel. I am a Senior at Texas A&M University located in <a

                            Station,
                            TX</a>. I was born and raised in a town called <a
                            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vadodara">Vadodara</a> located in the eastern part of
                        India. After
                        graduation, my family decided to immigrate to the United States of America where I began my
                        higher education at <a href="https://howdy.tamu.edu/uPortal/normal/render.uP">Texas A&M

                    <div>My love for Computer Science began when I was in a CSCE-121 course lead by <a
                            href="https://people.engr.tamu.edu/pcr/index.html"> Dr. Philip Ritchey.</a>
                        Dr. Ritchey was an amazing professor who not only taught me how to write "Hello World" in
                        C++
                        but
                        his teaching methodology inspired me to become a <a

                            Teacher</a> in the Computer Science

                        students in
                        <a href="https://catalog.tamu.edu/undergraduate/course-descriptions/csce/"> CSCE 121, 221, and

                    <div>My major at Texas A&M University was <a

                            Engineering.</a> but after the first semester
                        here, I
                        discovered what amazing the field of is and I applied to transfer into

                        Chicago
                        where I worked on the Payment Management Platform called Discover DDX. My project while at
                        Discover was to design, implement and deploy a full-stack testing suite in Java, Cucumber,
                        and
                        Selenium. For the Summer of 2021, I will be working as a <a

                    <div>Apart from teaching, my hobbies include Kayaking, Cooking, and Biking. I have participated
                        in numerous Kayaking events hosted in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VRsQFrYo47aXTf3g6">Lady Bird
                            Lake in Austin</a>. My hobbies also include rock
                        climbing and traveling to various countries during Summer break. I have been to Singapore,
                        Malaysia, Thailand, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Czechia. My love for
                        traveling began in 2007 when my family took me to Nepal for a rock climbing summit on the
                        Himalayas.
